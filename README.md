Project Title: Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard

Description:
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales data from a supermarket chain. The dashboard provides insights into total sales revenue over time, sales variations across branches and product lines, payment type distributions, average transaction values, and the relationship between customer ratings and sales revenue. This project aims to help supermarket management make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and increase profitability.

Business Questions Addressed:
1. Total Sales Revenue Over Time:
Objective: Determine the total sales revenue generated over a specific period.
Approach: Aggregated sales data to calculate total revenue over time. Created line charts to visualize revenue trends and identify peak sales periods.

2.Sales Variations Across Branches and Product Lines:
Objective: Analyze how sales of different product lines vary across different branches.
Approach: Used pivot tables to break down sales data by product line and branch. Created bar charts and heatmaps to compare sales performance across branches and product lines.

3.Top Contributing Product Lines:
Objective: Identify which product lines contribute the most to overall sales.
Approach: Calculated the percentage contribution of each product line to total sales. Visualized the data using pie charts and bar charts to highlight top-performing product lines.

4.Branch-wise Payment Type Percentages:
Objective: Determine the distribution of payment types used in each branch and analyze it by customer type and gender.
Approach: Used pivot tables to calculate payment type percentages for each branch. Created stacked bar charts and slicers to filter data by customer type (e.g., member, non-member) and gender, providing a detailed view of payment preferences.

5.Average Transaction Value per Branch:
Objective: Calculate the average transaction value (total sales revenue per transaction) for each branch.
Approach: Divided total sales revenue by the number of transactions for each branch. Presented the results using bar charts to compare average transaction values across branches.

6. Correlation Between Customer Ratings and Sales Revenue:
Objective: Investigate if there is a correlation between customer ratings and total sales revenue.
Approach: Used scatter plots to visualize the relationship between customer ratings and sales revenue. Calculated the correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.

Tools and Techniques Used:
1. Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, calculation of summary statistics, and creation of visualizations.
2. Visualization Tools: Excel charts, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.
3. Data Analysis: Pivot tables, correlation analysis, and percentage calculations to derive insights from the data.

Key Insights:
1. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance over time, highlighting trends and peak periods.
2. Branch-wise and product line sales analysis reveals significant variations in sales performance, helping identify strengths and areas for improvement.
3. Top-contributing product lines are easily identifiable, allowing for focused marketing and inventory strategies.
4. Payment type distributions offer insights into customer preferences, aiding in payment processing and customer service improvements.
5. Average transaction values across branches help assess the efficiency and profitability of each branch.
6. The correlation analysis between customer ratings and sales revenue provides valuable insights into the impact of customer satisfaction on sales performance.

Conclusion:
The Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for supermarket management to analyze and optimize sales performance across branches and product lines. By leveraging the insights provided, management can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and increase overall profitability.
